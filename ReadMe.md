## Implementation of ADAS algorithms on F1/10th using Arduino IDE.

**Objective:**

The objective was to design and implement the vehicle control algorithms such that vehicle was able to maintain a distance of 30cm from any object placed ahead of it. It was also required to stop the vehicle 30cm away from a stationary obstacle placed ahead of it. The second was to maintain a distance of 40cm from the side wall and remain in the center of the defined lane.

For this activity, an initial sub-task of implementing sensor signal processing was accomplished, and then the task of developing ADAS algorithms for the F1/10th car were undertaken.

### 1. Sensor signal processing:

**1a. Sensor fusion with digital filtering**

### 2. ACC and Lane-keeping
[Implementation details can be found here](https://github.com/shorane/ADAS_Algorithms_on_F1_10th/tree/master/Adaptive%20Cruise%20Control%20and%20Autonomous%20Lane%20Keeping)

**For ACC**
 - Sampling the time data received from the sensor
 - Implementing Exponential Filter
 - PID Implementation
 - PWM Implementation

**For Lane Keeping**
 - Sampling the time data received from the sensor
 - Implementing Exponential Filter
 - PID Implementation
